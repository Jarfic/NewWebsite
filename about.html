                <p>Mission statement: At Rstick One our goal is to make not just
                    functioning controllers, but controllers made with quality and
                    comfort across all gaming platforms for a price within reason.

                <h2>Our Purpose</h2>
                <p>Throughout the years i've used a fair amount of controllers.
                    And while i may admit part of the reason is myself, often,
                    over extended use they begin to wear down and not function properly.
                    When buying new controllers the range is skewed from getting a cheap
                    controller that break down even faster or getting an overly expensive
                    controller that doesn't need to be. I've seen others have the problem of
                    not being able to get more controllers and/or having completely busted
                    ones because of this. This business's purpose is to be that halfway 
                    point.
